# Context

-   **Current Focus**: Database migration from Supabase to Prisma/PostgreSQL.
-   **Recent Changes**: Supabase dependencies and client utilities have been removed. Prisma ORM has been integrated, and all client-side database access has been refactored into Next.js Server Actions (`lib/actions/`). The memory bank's `brief.md` file has been updated to better reflect the project's scope and architecture.
-   **Next Steps**: The system is ready for database setup (migration/seeding) and further development.
